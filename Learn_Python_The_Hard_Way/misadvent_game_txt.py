big_chop_intro = '''You just got invited on a date this Saturday with a hot guy. Yay! He prefers girls with long silky hair. Up until yesterday, that would've been fine by you,considering your waist-length locks, part of what attracted him to you in the first place. However, you had been transitioning for the past 6 months. Last night, as you lamented the struggles of managing 2 textures, India Arie's 'I am not my hair' came on the radio and you got the bright idea to chop off all your hair. With pending date in 48 hours, you're now working with a 3-inch TWA aka Teeny Weeny ____. '''


braid_salon_intro = "Fatou, a Senegalese stylist, assumes that you like her prior customers prefer her tight braiding method. She draws a part and grabs your strands to form a braid. You feel the individual hairs being ripped from your scalp. You must recite the magic command to rescue your hairline from her clutch. 'Less tension on my ____ please!'? "

braid_salon_exit = "She finishes the style. You look nice on your date (though a bit alien-like) because your hairline looks like you have braids sprouting directly from your scalp. A month into dating him, you're having a steamy makeout session and during the close-eyedlip-locking he runs his hands through the back of your head. A braid slips out into hand with your strands attached (bulb & all). He's freaked out and runs away. You never hear from him again."

 
blowout_salon_intro ="Maria, Dominican stylist, sews a few tracks around your head for length & volume. She leaves out your edges and U-part section of your crown for a natural effect. Because you're unrelaxed, she's gotta heat-straighten to blend with your silky, bone-straight weave. 'Please spray heat _____ before passing the iron.'' " 

dom_salon_prompt = "\tCan she keep passing the hot iron on your hair until it matches?"

dom_salon_exit = "Walk out wearing a headband over your leave-out. Date goes okay but you're self-conscious about your look and even moreso when he asks why you're wearing a sweatband outside of the gym? :-/"

wig_store_intro = "With your budget, a wig is the best option. Need help finding best option. 'Please help me find a lace wig with ____ bands and combs'. "

home_wig_prompt = "So many styles to choose from at the MegaWig Beauty Supply Store. Torn between lace wigs held on by adhesive versus those using elastic bands, you opt for one with adhesive. Crust builds up on your hairline and when he tries to help you out by flicking at the tiny, crystal chunk on your hairline, the chunk breaks off and the wig falls back onto your chair. How does he react?"

home_wig_exit= "Kill him for hurting your feelings and then become a fugitive on the run for the rest of your life"

home_hair_closet_intro = "You need to get some crochet braids! Ask your sister where put the last 2 unused bags of _____ hair. "

home_crochet_prompt = "Your hands are getting tired having to manipulate that Kanekelon to make it to look less like plastic. Do you accept the challenge of pushing through despite your intense finger and wrist pain and keep styling?"

home_crochet_exit = "Overly stressed by manipulating Kanelelon to get it to look human, your hands fall off and you're now stuck with an almost cute style but no hands."


date_intro = "He asks why your hair looks a little different. Coquettishly explain that you'd been ______ for months and recently did a bigchop."

game_win_msg = "Hooray. You go on many more dates and then get married and live happily ever after. The End."
